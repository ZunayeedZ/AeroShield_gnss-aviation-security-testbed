# AeroShield_gnss-aviation-security-testbed
This repository contains the full implementation of a high-fidelity GNSS simulation-based cybersecurity testbed designed for aviation resilience research. The framework enables end-to-end signal generation, processing, and reception. In future, evaluation of realistic attacks like spoofing &amp; jamming will be evaluated.
